{"name":"Hcprobe","tagline":"Framework for testing OpenFlow controllers","body":"Introduction\r\n=======\r\n\r\n  HCProbe is a tool for testing OpenFlow controllers. It includes\r\n  a library in Haskell that provides means to work with OpenFlow\r\n  protocol. Also it includes a reference implementation of an OpenFlow\r\n  software switch and a domain-specific language (EDSL) for constructing\r\n  new custom switches.\r\n  \r\nBuild\r\n=======\r\n\r\n  To build hcprobe you need cabal.\r\n  \r\n  To build it in a sandbox use cabal-dev tool:\r\n\r\n    cabal insatall cabal-dev\r\n  \r\n  Building hcprobe with cabal-dev:\r\n    \r\n    cd src\r\n    cabal update\r\n    cabal-dev install-deps\r\n    cabal-dev configure\r\n    cabal-dev build\r\n    \r\n  Executables can be found in ./dist/build/\r\n  \r\n  To run the reference switch implementation:\r\n    \r\n    ./dist/build/hcprobe/hcprobe\r\n    \r\n  By default it runs 16 OpenFlow switches which try to connect\r\n  to an OpenFlow controller at 127.0.0.1, port 6633.\r\n  Run with --help for more settings.\r\n  \r\n  For more information on writing tests with EDSL see Documentation.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
